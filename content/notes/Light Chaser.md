The top down view above shows the process of [TurtleBot](https://www.turtlebot.com) autonomously navigating and mapping across unknown obstructed environment. The red markers are the _frontiers_ used to highlight navigation points. Green markings are from the Lidar sensor. You can see the little TurtleBot moving around in the map!

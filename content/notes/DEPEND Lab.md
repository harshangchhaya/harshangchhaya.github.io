This project focused on enhancing the real-time safety of Neural Network Controlled Systems (e.g., robots) by formal verification. The primary contribution involved updating the Neural Network architecture of the safety verification tool [POLAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13867) with high-performance computing techniques. The result is significant speed improvements in the safety check allowing for real-time safety verification. Extensive simulation testing was conducted for reliability. The outcomes provide valuable insights into improving safety verification processes for Neural Network Controlled Systems.

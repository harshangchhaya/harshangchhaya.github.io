This project focused on enhancing the real-time safety of Neural Network Controlled Systems (e.g., robots) by formal verification. The primary contribution involved updating the Neural Network architecture of the safety verification tool [POLAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13867) with high-performance computing techniques. The result is significant speed improvements in the safety check. Extensive simulation testing was conducted for reliability. The outcomes provide valuable insights into improving safety verification processes for Neural Network Controlled Systems.

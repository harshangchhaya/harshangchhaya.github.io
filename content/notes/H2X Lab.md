This project focused on leveraging offline reinforcement learning for autonomous navigation. The objective was to explore and identify a practical reward function for q-learning algorithms. By employing adversarial inverse reinforcement learning, a reward function was generated to guide the learning process. The project's findings and methodology were meticulously documented for the lab, providing valuable insights for future research endeavors in this domain.

During my robotics internship as an R&D intern, I contributed to various aspects of the field. I developed ROS packages to enable robot navigation with a controller, enhancing the systemsâ€™ capabilities. Additionally, I created an educational resource tailored for robotics, facilitating the training of employees in the field. Through collaborative teamwork, I actively participated in the construction of robots and navigation in real-life and simulation environments from the ground up. This internship provided valuable hands-on experience and fostered my growth in the robotics domain.
